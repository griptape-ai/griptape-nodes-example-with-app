# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development

**Commands**

All development commands use the Makefile:

```bash
make check # check linting/formatting/type errors
make fix # fix autofixable errors
make run # run the Gradio app
```

**Iteration Loop**

When developing, follow this iteration loop:

1. **Make the change**: make the changes required to implement a feature or fix a bug
1. **Run checks**: run `make check` (or `make fix`) to see if any linting/formatting/type errors arose
1. **Fix issues**: resolve all issues from previous step
1. **Continue working**: continue to the next change

## Code Style Preferences

**Avoid Tuples For Return Values** - Tuples should be a last resort. When unavoidable, use NamedTuples for clarity. Prefer separate variables, class instances, or other data structures.

**Simple, Readable Logic Flow** - Prefer simple, easy-to-follow logic over complex nested expressions:

- Use explicit if/else statements instead of ternary operators or nested conditionals
- Avoid complex nested expressions - break them into clear, separate statements
- Example: Instead of `value = func() if condition else None`, use:
    ```python
    if condition:
        value = func()
    else:
        value = None
    ```

**CRITICAL: Evaluate ALL failure cases first, success path ONLY at the end** - This is MANDATORY unless explicitly asked otherwise:

- ALL validation checks, error conditions, and failure cases MUST be at the top of the function
- Each failure case should exit immediately (return/raise) with a clear error message
- The success path MUST be at the absolute bottom of the function - never return in the middle
- If there are multiple return statements in the success path, you're probably doing it wrong (unless explicitly requested)
- Bad example:
    ```python
    def process_data(value):
        if value > 0:
            result = calculate(value)
            return result  # SUCCESS IN MIDDLE
        return "Error: value must be positive"  # Failure at end
    ```
- Good example:
    ```python
    def process_data(value):
        if value <= 0:  # FAILURE FIRST
            return "Error: value must be positive"
        if value > 1000:  # MORE FAILURES
            return "Error: value too large"

        # SUCCESS PATH AT END
        result = calculate(value)
        return result
    ```

**CRITICAL: Do NOT use lazy imports** - Imports MUST be at the top of the file:

- ALL imports MUST be at the top of the file in standard order - this is the default and expected pattern
- NEVER use lazy imports (imports inside functions) unless absolutely necessary to resolve a circular import
- If you think you need a lazy import, STOP and explain to the user why you think it's necessary, then ASK for confirmation before proceeding
- The ONLY valid reason for a lazy import is an unavoidable circular import that cannot be resolved through refactoring
- If you must use a lazy import, you MUST add a comment explaining exactly why it's necessary and what circular import it's resolving
- Bad example:
    ```python
    def process_data(value):
        from some_module import helper  # NO! Move to top
        return helper(value)
    ```
- Good example (only if circular import is unavoidable):
    ```python
    def process_data(value):
        # Lazy import required: circular dependency between this module and some_module
        # some_module imports MyClass from this file, and we need helper from some_module
        from some_module import helper
        return helper(value)
    ```

## Exception Handling

**CRITICAL: Only wrap code that actually raises exceptions** - Never add try/except blocks speculatively:

- Before adding exception handling, verify the code actually raises exceptions (check documentation, source code, or type hints)
- Do NOT add try/except blocks "just in case" or because code "might" fail
- Unnecessary exception handling creates misleading code and unnecessary nesting
- If you're unsure whether code raises exceptions, ASK the user first

**Use specific, narrow exception blocks** - Broad exception handling makes debugging impossible:

- Catch ONLY the specific exception types that can be raised (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, not `Exception`)
- Keep try blocks as small as possible - wrap only the exact line(s) that raise exceptions
- Each distinct operation that can fail should have its own try/except with a specific error message
- Never use bare `except:` or catch `Exception` unless explicitly required
- Bad example:
    ```python
    try:
        data = load_file(path)
        processed = transform_data(data)
        result = save_output(processed)
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {e}"
    ```
- Good example:
    ```python
    try:
        data = load_file(path)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return f"Error: File not found at {path}"

    try:
        processed = transform_data(data)
    except ValueError as e:
        return f"Error: Invalid data format - {e}"

    try:
        result = save_output(processed)
    except PermissionError:
        return f"Error: Cannot write to output location"
    ```

**Include context in error messages** - Always provide meaningful context to help users understand where errors occur:

- Include relevant parameter names, object identifiers, or operation context
- This helps users identify which specific component or operation failed
- Bad example:
    ```python
    logger.warning("Invalid input received")
    return "Error: Processing failed"
    ```
- Good example:
    ```python
    logger.warning(f"Subprocess invocation received invalid input: {input_value}")
    return f"Error: Failed to process subprocess output"
    ```
